Bivararte datasets 
*It has two variable and it deals with the relationship between the two variables.
*Example: The sales of ice cream versus the temperature 

Multivariate Datasets 
*A dataset with multiple variables
*It contains three or more than three data types(variables)
 Ex: measure length,width,height,volume of a rectangualr box.

Categorical Datasets with two values
*It represents features or characteritics of a person or an object 
 Ex1: A person's gender
    2 Marital Status

Categorical datasets with more than two values 
  EX: survey - very satisfied to very dissatisfied
  	  Health care - mild ,moderate, or severe symptom 

Correlation Datasets 
 values dependent on each other

 3 types: positive correlation - Two varibales move in same direction
 		  negative correlation - Two variables move in opposite direction 
 		  No or zero correlation - No relationship b/w two variables

mean,median,mode, and range of datasets
 *mean of a datasets is the average of all observation present in the table
 *mean=sum of observations/Total numbers of elements in data set
 *median of a dataset is the middle value of the collection of data when arranged in ascending order and desecding order
 *mode of a dataset is the variable or number or value which is repeated maximum number of times
 *Range of dataset is difference between maximum and minimum value

properties of dataset
 To understand the nature of data we can use Exploratory data analysis(EDA)

 properties of datatsets 
 1.Centre of data 
 2.skeness of data 
 3.Spread among the data members 
 4.presence of outliers
 5.correlation among the data
 6.Type of probability distribution that the data follows

Pie chart 
Syntax- pie(x,labels,radius,main,col,clockwise)

Box plot 
Syntax - pie(x, data, notch,varwidth,names,main)

Line Graphs 
Synatax - plot(v, type,column,xlab,ylab)

Scatter plot 
Syntax - plot(x,y,main,xlab,ylab,xlim,ylim,axes)

Hypothesis Testing 
It is often used by scientists to test specific predictions, called hypothesis that arise from theories that is 'Currently accepted value for a parameter(population)'
It is statistical method used in making a statistical decision using experimental data 
A hypothesis is simply a claim or statement about population parameters and that we want to set 

Hypothesis testing 
Widely defines - all automobiles 
Narrowly defined - all ford mustang cars produced from 2002 to 2005
 Null hypothesis H0 is the right one 
If we prove H0 false next will vibe alternative hypothesis

Descriptive stats               Population (parameter)              Sample (Statistics)

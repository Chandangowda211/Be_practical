Bivararte datasets 
*It has two variable and it deals with the relationship between the two variables.
*Example: The sales of ice cream versus the temperature 

Multivariate Datasets 
*A dataset with multiple variables
*It contains three or more than three data types(variables)
 Ex: measure length,width,height,volume of a rectangualr box.

Categorical Datasets with two values
*It represents features or characteritics of a person or an object 
 Ex1: A person's gender
    2 Marital Status

Categorical datasets with more than two values 
  EX: survey - very satisfied to very dissatisfied
  	  Health care - mild ,moderate, or severe symptom 

Correlation Datasets 
 values dependent on each other

 3 types: positive correlation - Two varibales move in same direction
 		  negative correlation - Two variables move in opposite direction 
 		  No or zero correlation - No relationship b/w two variables

mean,median,mode, and range of datasets
 *mean of a datasets is the average of all observation present in the table
 *mean=sum of observations/Total numbers of elements in data set
 *median of a dataset is the middle value of the collection of data when arranged in ascending order and desecding order
 *mode of a dataset is the variable or number or value which is repeated maximum number of times
 *Range of dataset is difference between maximum and minimum value

properties of dataset
 To understand the nature of data we can use Exploratory data analysis(EDA)

 properties of datatsets 
 1.Centre of data 
 2.skeness of data 
 3.Spread omong the data memebers 
 4.presence of outliers
 5.correlation among the data
 6.Type of probability distribution that the data follows
